Although this is a joke, it ACTUALLY WORKS. Unless you have the technical expertise required decrypt a GPG encrypted file, you should BE CAREFUL and only run it on a directory you don't care about. DO NOT exit the program once it has encrypted your files. The key will be lost forever. Instead, wait for it to finish encrypting. When it asks you for 1,000 dollars, just press [ENTER]. This will cause the program to decrypt the files. You do not actually have to pay money. Enjoy!
